I am a first-year doctoral student at The University of Tokyo.

<!-- I am a first-year doctoral student at The University of Tokyo. I earned a B.E. in 2022, followed by an M.E. in 2024, both from UTokyo.  
<br/>
My research interests lie in solving both fundamental and applied scientific problems in materials science and related fields through computational techniques.
Specifically, I focus on applying and developing a wide range of methods that I suppose helpful, including *ab initio* simulation, advanced artificial intelligence technologies, AI-powered techniques that merge these approaches, and methods integrating computational and materials characterization techniques. -->
